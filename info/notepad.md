Example to do : 

terminal : 
CMD : brainiac --exam
-> Show
-> Add
-> Remove
-> Calendar

CMD -> Select

Depending on selection : 

Show : 
Retrieves all the exams saved
Shows all the exams in a table format

Add : 
Ask for Class code

# @ SQLite - How to use it
Sat 01 Jun-06 2019 14:46:58


### Create a table 

```python

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('AA_db.sqlite')
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute('CREATE TABLE experiments (name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR)')
conn.commit()

conn.close()

```

### Adding Data to table

```python

cur.execute('INSERT INTO experiments (name, description) VALUES (?, ?)',
            ('Another User', 'Another Experiment, even using " other characters"'))
conn.commit()

```

### Retreive Data from table

```python

cur.execute('SELECT * FROM experiments WHERE name="Aquiles"')
data_3 = cur.fetchall()
```

### Primary Key

```python

sql_command = """
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS experiments;
CREATE TABLE experiments (
    id INTEGER,
    name VARCHAR,
    description VARCHAR,
    PRIMARY KEY (id));
INSERT INTO experiments (name, description) values ("Aquiles", "My experiment description");
INSERT INTO experiments (name, description) values ("Aquiles 2", "My experiment description 2");
"""
cur.executescript(sql_command)
conn.commit()
```

### Relational Databases

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS experiments;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
CREATE TABLE  users(
    id INTEGER,
    name VARCHAR,
    email VARCHAR,
    phone VARCHAR,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id));
CREATE TABLE experiments (
    id INTEGER,
    user_id INTEGER,
    description VARCHAR ,
    perfomed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id));
```

# @ Edit specific part of an exam and leave everything else alone

- Edit
- Ask uer what they want to edit
- Ask if they are done with the edit
- Have a done option 
- While not done 

- Pseudocode : 
- quitFlag = false
- while quitFlag != True :
  - ans = ask_input
  - if ans == quit :
    - quitFlag = True
    - break

- ans = Ask_input()Exam
- returns the strinExamedit
- based on that, weExamt to keep intact
- must retrieve eveExam
- cur.execute("SELEExamd=?", (6,))
- data = cur.fetchaExam
- print(data)
- examInfo[ans] -> return the index
   questions = [
        {
            'type': 'input',
            'name': ans,
            'message': ans + ":",
        }
    ]

# @ How to calculate the amount of time studied ?
Sun 02 Jun-06 2019 22:19:58

- idea :
in the school app :

- exam info
- exam timing

- exam timing : 
  - checks the exams_db
  - return a list of exams
  - ask you which one you want to monitor
  - -> gets the id so that it can modify the study time when finished
  - starts a stopwatch -> you can cancel anytime using q ?
  - stopped -> adds the time that it recorded to the amount of time it already has 

---

# @ Stopwatch -> register in table
Tue 04 Jun-06 2019 18:52:52

Flow :
- Open app
- Open exam section
- Open stopwatch option
- This will "show" the available exms
- It will then ask for the id you want to record the study time. 
- Then it will start the stopwatch -> possible animation 
- User stops the study section 
- Retrieve the study time of the id
- Append the new time to the old time and register the result into the table

TODO : 
* [X] ~~*multiple menu -> (exam , homework)*~~ [2019-06-04] 
* [X] ~~*make exam class -> might need a re-definition of how stuff is being sent to the sql_helper functions*~~ [2019-06-04] 
* [ ] stopwatch option -> stopwatch function

---

# @ Exam as a class

class Exam : 
attributes :
- Class Code
- type
- Date due
- Study time accumulated 

Why would we need an object here. 
We would need, when we need to read in individually exams ... 
So that it is easy to get its individual attributes

# Homework quick preview plan 
Tue 04 Jun-06 2019 18:50:00

â€¢ Exam 
1. Name
2. Date
3. Location 

Goal : to store homework exercises and general notes better. With tags !

Written study notes.
Then take picture of it. 
Writing text to computer text
Sorts it into the correct folder
And puts tags on it for later search
ing and documentation

Homework exercises. 
Tags. 
Number the exercises. Detect that.

Flow : 
Take writing notes.
Put tags.
Upload to photos.
Download to desktop.
Open school CLI
Go to Homework and Notes mode
Go to add pictures
Pass in the file path
Store the file in correct directory given the tags analyzed.

Have the outlines in the application. 
Can open anytime in PDF 

Homework class
Easy.medium.hard.final exam level
Progress bar percentage done
Date
Folder where it is. Image 
Tags

Use the expand tab of PyInquirer

Make the app executable from CLI

If OCR really does not work,
Just write down the tags you think are appropriate. And then when you put in Computer, just write them down. 

How to make TAGS with Sqlite

Expands types of tags ???
Create new tags

Main Classes : 
â€¢ Exams
â€¢ Assignments
â€¢ Lab 
â€¢ Homework 
    - Easy - Medium - Hard
    - Percentage done
    - Folder where it is 
    - Tags -> have the tags use the PyInquirer expands
â€¢ Notes
    - if OCR is too hard -> just write down the TAGS and then its easier to type it out
â€¢ Outline
    - can open with PDF
â€¢ Slides
    - can open with OKULAR to be able to make modifications (+ make a MarkDown file -> when we open it so that we can take notes also)
    -  in the markdown file -> put some special TAGS where we can specify parts where I am stuck or soemthing
    -  or have a issue.md , etc ... 

- Every one of them should have a controller (takes care of the sqlite operations and other stuff)
- Controller : 
- sqlite maintenance
- show()

Special Controller : (they will be special controllers that will maitain a group of main classes)
- DueController (handles everything that has a due date)

- EACH SCHOOl CLASS -> has its own Folder it will contain everything :
  - own databases
  - own resources
  - own text files 

directory example : 

- school :
  - databases
    - exam_db
    - notes_db
    - ...
  - COEN 355
    - outline.pdf
    - db.sqlite (this database will contain the information about that class) -> have to make sure we have the same information for all the components
    - Homeworks 
      - files
    - Assignments
      - files
    - Lab
      - Lab Reports
      - files
    - Notes
    - Slides

Have to think out what each componenets kind of Attributes will have.

Each Class :

- info directory (todo.md issues.md)

Exams :
- name
- classCode
- dueDate
- daysLeft
- studyTime
- description (what is on the exam)

Assignments :
- name
- classCode
- dueDate
- daysLeft
- instructionsFilePath / questionsFilePath
- answersFilePath
- percentageCompletion

Lab Report : 
- name
- classCode
- dueDate
- daysLeft
- description
- instructionsFilePath / questionsFilePath
- reportFilePath
- percentageCompletion

# --- # 

Homework : 
- name
- classCode
- dueDate

- difficulty

# --- # 

Notes :

# @ How to start

- Try to abstract the helper functions as much as possible 
- For Example, the ExamContoller.py stuff can be done for the other deliverables ... 

- Will need of SqLite handling - 
- Making Directories
- Asking Input 
- Opening Files in a desired program depending on the file

# @ Adding text or descriptions and stuff or opening text editors

https://pypi.org/project/text-editor/

```python
import texteditor
text = texteditor.open('This is the starting content')
```

---

# @ Opening File Manager giving the directory

``` python
shell("ranger /home/namv/Pictures/Webcam")

import os
filepath = "\...\folder"
os.system("ranger " + filepath)
```

# @ How to open a TUI without clearing the background 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35400904/how-to-popup-a-ncurses-widget-without-clearing-background

# @ Passing classes as arguments

! You can pass classes as arguments to access the static variables they have. 

# @ How to calculate the percentage done of something 

Which item needs it : 
- Assignments
- Lab Reports
- Homework

Add an option to add a percentage done to these ones :
 * work like boostnote
 * at creation we put the number of total numbers to do

 Assignments = numbers total to do
 Homework = number total to do
 Lab Reports = number of sections done 

 shows a percentage bar in the table 

homework init status to 0
ask how many numbers are there = total
each time you are doing homework, after finishing it, 
Ask how many done, adds that to the current and calculates the percentage from that 

# @ How to edit some stuff

- itemClass 
-> ask which attribute to change
-> with the attribute 
-> with the id 

- uset the set_item_attribute

# @ Notes

Notes :
- classCode
- chapter
